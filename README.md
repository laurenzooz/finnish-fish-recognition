### Finnish fish species classifier using convolutional neural network
A small project for me to practice Python, Tensorflow and neural networks. The goal is to train an ai that is able to recognize the fish species in a picture.
For now the goal is to make the neural network good enough to fairly accurately recognize a few different fish species found in Finland. 
The species are: bream, burbot, perch, pike, roach, ruffe and zander. 
For copyright reasons the training data is not included.
